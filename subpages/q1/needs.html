        ‎ 1. First, we would need to plan out the information, media, and the script that our group will use in order to create our 
        <br> ‎ educational documentary.  And keeping our audiences’ interest in mind, we will have to craft an engaging storyline and video, 
        <br> ‎ while also making sure that the information we’ll use throughout the educational documentary is correct, true, and focuses on
        <br>‎ our main point, which is to spread awareness about the problems of Sitio Bebe and to promote our fundraising concert. <br>
        <br>
        ‎ 2. In addition to interviews, we can include footage that captures the daily activities of the community, showcasing both the 
        <br> ‎ hardships and the resilience of its members. This visual storytelling will help to engage the audience on an emotional level, 
        <br> ‎ encouraging them to empathize with the people of Sitio Bebe. Ultimately, our goal is to raise awareness about their situation and 
        <br>‎ inspire viewers to take action, whether through donations, volunteering, or advocating for support for the community.<br>
        <br>
        ‎  3. The audience requires content that builds a strong emotional bond through impactful storytelling, provides transparency by
       <br> ‎ demonstrating how funds are utilized, promotes active involvement with interactive updates, and features a clear, compelling
       <br> ‎ call-to-action to inspire immediate donations. <br>
        <br>
        ‎  4. Finally end the video with clear instructions on how to purchase tickets (e.g., website, phone number, QR codes).
        <br> ‎ Include early bird offers or group discounts to encourage quick action. People’s attention spans are short, especially on 
        <br> ‎ social media. Short videos that are 15–30 seconds can quickly engage potential attendees. Video content is more engaging
        <br> ‎  and more likely to be shared compared to text-based posts. Short videos with a compelling call-to-action can lead directly to
        <br> ‎ ticket purchases, increasing the number of attendees at the concert.</h1>
